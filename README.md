# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm Tushar (or 2sr in short), a code enthusiast with a penchant for crafting elegant solutions and a knack for making computers do my bidding.

## About Me
- 💻 Full-stack developer by day, code ninja by night.
- 🌱 Currently learning how to juggle JavaScript frameworks without dropping them.
- 🎨 Turning coffee into code and debugging into a form of art.
- 🚀 On a mission to conquer the tech world, one bug at a time.
- 🛠️ PHP wizard casting spells with code, networking like it's a social event for routers.
- 🧑‍💻 Tinkering in my home lab with Raspberry Pi's, IoT, and more cables than I can count.
- 📡 Networking enthusiast: two Dell servers and a 25-gig Mikrotik switch make my home lab a tech playground.

## Fun Facts 🎉
- 🍕 Pizza is my spirit animal.
- 🧩 Solving coding puzzles faster than a Rubik's Cube.
- 🌟 Secret talent: Debugging code with my eyes closed (just kidding... or am I?).
- 🤖 I speak fluent binary, with a slight accent in hexadecimal.
- 💡 Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
- ⚡️ I can make a Raspberry Pi do the Cha-Cha Slide... metaphorically speaking.
- 🖥️ My servers never sleep, but I do have a power nap function.
- 📶 My love for networking is so strong, even my Wi-Fi has a crush on me!
